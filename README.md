Algorithms Practices - Java

## Array  
- 01_twoSum  
  - Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,  
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,  
    return [0, 1].  
    
- 26_Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
  - Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new    length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
  
- 53_Maximum Subarray  
  - Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.  

- 66_Plus One  
  - Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.  
  
- 88_Merge Sorted Array  
  - Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.  
  
- 118_Pascal's Triangle  
  - Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.  
  
- 119_Pascal's Triangle II  
  - Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle. Note that the row index starts from 0. (In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.) (Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?)  
  
- 121_Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
  - Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.  
  
- 566_Reshape the Matrix  
  - In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data. You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively. The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were. If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.  
    - The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].  
    - The given r and c are all positive.  

## Dynamic Programming  
- 198_House Robber  
  - You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. 
  
## Linked List
- 21_Merge Two Sorted Lists  
  - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.  
  
- 83_Remove Duplicates from Sorted List  
  - Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.  
  
- 160_Intersection of Two Linked Lists  
  - Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.  
    - Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3  
    - Output: Reference of the node with value = 8  
    
- 203_Remove Linked List Elements  
  - Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.
